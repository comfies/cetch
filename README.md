### Usage

cetch skips out on any bloat: there's no options, parameters, runtime
configs. the only thing to do when using cetch is to call it, it's that
simple.

### Configuration

please see [`config.def.h`](/config.def.h) for instruction on how to
configure. when compiling, it's copied over to `config.h` which is the file
that the user (you) will use for configuring cetch.

### To-Do

- [ ] Implement logos (left-aligned *and* right-aligned).
- [ ] Get the window manager (optionally supported)
